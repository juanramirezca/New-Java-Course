Welcome to Snakes and Ladders, we're going to recreate a common game with Python Code.
Let's get started in the programming world!  
The team members are Daniela Silva and Renata Silva 

The rules are simple:
The number of players is two.
The first one who arrives at the 100 place, wins. The two players will throw the dice, the one who gets the biggest number, will start the game.
If you find a snake, you will fall. On the other hand, you will go upstairs if you find a ladder.
